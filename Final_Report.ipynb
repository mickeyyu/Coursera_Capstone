    "2. Price range $350,000 to $450,000.\n",

    "***Second***, we found that https://www.picketfencepreview.com has an extensive sale-list coverage for Vermont counties including **Chitteden**: https://www.picketfencepreview.com/buy-a-home/homes-for-sale-by-county/state/VT/county/Chittenden, where we can use BeautifulSoup to scrape address, price, address, baths information. Then we will perform query to obtain the list of home-for-sale which meet client's requirement for price, bedrooms, baths requirements.\n",
    "              \n",
    "***Third***, we shall obtain geographical coordinate location data of each home-for-sale in \n",
    "Chittenden county. Then we will obtain Foursquare location data for nearby venues and \n",
    "their corresponding ratings and tips to determine the venue quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Finaly***, based on all above, we shall pick a neighborhood that meets our client's requirements.\n",
